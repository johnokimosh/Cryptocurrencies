# Module 18 - Unsupervised ML and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

Client reguests a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investments.

Data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. With no known output, we will use unsupervised learning to group the cryptocurrencies with a clustering algorithm, and we will use data visualizations to share the findings with the client.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
